* REST APIs built with Spring Boot
* Uses Spring Data JPA + Hibernate
* Clean layered architecture (Controller → Repository → Entity)
* Handles business logic like inventory reduction

To run backend:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🗄️ Database (MySQL)

* MySQL is used for persistent data storage
* Database name and table schemas are provided in the project
* Tables include:

  * `product`
  * `orders`
  * `order_item`
  * `users`

Create database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE warehouse_db;
```

Update database configuration in:

```
backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
```

---

## 🔗 API Communication

Frontend communicates with backend using REST APIs via Axios.

Example:

```ts
GET /api/products
POST /api/orders
PUT /api/orders/{id}/status
```
